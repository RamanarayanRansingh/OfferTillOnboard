## 🎢 Welcome to the Talent Acquisition Rollercoaster!

Ever felt like you're on a wild ride when it comes to hiring? One moment you're up with a great candidate accepting your offer, and the next, you're plummeting as they ghost you faster than a Tinder date. Welcome to **"Offer Till On Board"** - where we turn this rollercoaster into a smooth monorail ride!

## 🕵️‍♀️ The Case of the Vanishing Candidates

Originally conceived as a Comviva capstone project, this solo adventure tackles a puzzling phenomenon in the world of HR:

> "We've got candidates saying 'I do' to our job offers, but they're pulling a runaway bride at the altar of onboarding!" - Frustrated HR Manager

This corporate edition of "Ghostbusters" is costing companies more than just hurt feelings - we're talking serious moolah and time down the drain!

## 🔮 Our Crystal Ball (But Way More Scientific)

We're not here to read tea leaves or gaze into crystal balls. We're data scientists, and we've got something better - a predictive model that's so good, it could tell you if your coffee will be cold before you even brew it!

### What We're Cooking Up:
- 🧠 A brain that learns from past hiring data
- 🔍 A magnifying glass to spot potential ghosts (ahem, we mean candidates who might not join)
- 💡 Insights sharper than your colleague's PowerPoint transitions

## 🛠️ Our Secret Sauce

1. **Data Détente**: We're diving deep into the data lake, fishing for insights.
2. **Feature Alchemy**: Turning raw data into golden predictors.
3. **Model Runway**: We're letting different models strut their stuff to see which one's got the best predictive swagger.
4. **Tuning Symphony**: Fine-tuning our model like a Formula 1 pit crew.
5. **Crystal Clear Clarity**: Because if we can't explain it, it's just expensive guessing.

## 📊 The "Holy Cow!" Results

| Metric | Score | In Human Speak |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Accuracy | 82.30% | We're right more often than your weather app! |
| ROC AUC | 0.749 | Our model could be a part-time psychic |
| F1 Score | 0.349 | We're balancing precision and recall like a tightrope walker |

## 🎭 The Cast of Predictors
